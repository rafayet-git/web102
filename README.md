# Codepath Intermetiate Web Development WEB102
This is all of the projects and labs that I have done for [this](https://www.codepath.org/courses/web-development) course in Codepath.

I didn't have the time to complete this course normally, so I had to do this at my own time. Because of this, I didn't dedicate as much attention to CSS styling in my projects as I should have.
